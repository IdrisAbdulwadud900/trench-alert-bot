## IF YOU SAY "APPROVED"

We immediately begin Phase 2:

**Phase 2: Implementation (Code)**
1. Code the home screen (buttons)
2. Code the Track Coin flow
3. Code message handlers
4. Code storage structure
5. Test everything

**No more design changes** until we ship Phase 1.

---

## IF YOU SAY "NEEDS CHANGES"

We pause and update the design:

1. You specify changes above
2. We update PHASE_1_UX_DESIGN.md
3. We update PHASE_1_VALIDATION.md
4. We confirm again
5. Then Phase 2

## IMPORTANT

**Design first. Code second.**

This is the difference between shipping in 1 month vs. 3 months.

Clear design → Clear code → Fast shipping.

Unclear design → Rework mid-code → Slow shipping.

You're preventing future chaos by getting this right now. ✅
